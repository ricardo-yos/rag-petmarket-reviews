## Prerequisites

- Python version 3.10 or newer installed on your system.
- You need to have a valid `GROQ_API_KEY` set in your environment variables to access the required APIs.
- A computer with a GPU is recommended to speed up model processing, but not mandatory.

---

## Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed.

### 1. Clone the repository

Download the project to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ricardo-yos/rag-petmarket-reviews.git
cd rag-petmarket-reviews
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

Set up a dedicated Conda environment for the project:

```bash
conda create -n rag_env python=3.10
conda activate rag_env
```

### 3. Install dependencies

Install all required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Environment Setup

- Create a `.env` file at the project root and add your API keys or environment variables, for example:

```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

- Review and customize configuration files under `src/config/` as needed.

---

## Usage

### 1. Prepare the data

- `generate_json.py`: Integrates data from places and reviews into a unified JSON file, associating each place with its corresponding reviews.
- `build_db.py`: Creates chunked review texts and generates their embeddings, then stores them in a ChromaDB collection for semantic search.

```bash
cd src
python -m data_processing.generate_json       # Merge place and review data into JSON
python -m data_processing.build_db            # Chunk reviews and store embeddings in ChromaDB
cd ..                                         # Return to the project root
```

### 2. Launch the application

Start the assistant using **Streamlit**:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/src streamlit run src/app.py
```
> Make sure you're in the project root (`rag-petmarket-reviews/`) when running this command, so Python can locate the correct modules via `PYTHONPATH`.
>
> This will open a **web interface in your browser** where you can interact with the assistant via natural language.

### 3. User Interface (Streamlit)

The application uses Streamlit to deliver a simple and intuitive chat interface:

- Ask questions in **any language** about pet-related services.
- The assistant always responds in the **same language** as the user's question.
- It retrieves the most relevant **customer reviews** using **semantic search** and responds strictly based on that data.
- A **sidebar** allows you to configure the similarity threshold and number of documents retrieved.
- **Conversational memory** helps the assistant maintain context across multi-turn interactions.

**Example query**:

> ‚ùì "What are the main complaints about grooming services?"
>
> üí¨ "Based on customer reviews:
> - "Delays in starting the grooming service"
> - "Price considered too high for the quality of the service"
> - "Lack of communication about deadlines or the pet's status"

---

## Data Requirements

The project expects the following data formats and setup:

- **Input files**: Located in `data/raw/`:
  - `places.csv`: Contains metadata about pet-related businesses.
  - `reviews.csv`: Contains customer reviews linked by `place_id`.

- **Processed data**: Combined dataset generated by merging `places.csv` and `reviews.csv`, saved as `data/processed/places_reviews.json`. Containing both business information and associated reviews.

### Example structure

```json
[
  {
    "place_id": "abc123xyz",
    "name": "Pet Love Center",
    "street": "Rua das Flores, 123",
    "neighborhood": "Jardim Primavera",
    "city": "Santo Andr√©",
    "rating": 4.5,
    "num_reviews": 25,
    "type": "pet_store",
    "latitude": -23.000000,
    "longitude": -46.000000,
    "reviews": [
      {
        "review_id": "joana_silva_1729000000",
        "author": "Joana Silva",
        "rating": 5,
        "text": "Excelente atendimento! Minha cachorrinha foi muito bem cuidada no banho e tosa.",
        "review_length": 100,
        "word_count": 17,
        "time": 1729000000,
        "date": "2024-10-15 14:30:00",
        "response": "pt"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

- **Vector database**: Embedding index generated with a multilingual MiniLM model (`paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`), stored in `data/chroma/`.

Make sure to run the data processing scripts before launching the app to ensure all required files are in place.

---

## Configuration

The project uses configuration files to centralize and simplify the management of key settings.

### 1. `.env` File

Located at the project root (`rag-petmarket-reviews/.env`), this file contains environment variables such as API keys.

Example:

```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

This file is **not included in version control** (.gitignore) and must be created manually.

### 2. `app_config.yaml`

Path: `src/config/app_config.yaml`

Defines the app settings used by the RAGAssistant, such as:

- **LLM model**: Defines the language model used (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`, via Groq or another provider)
- **Vector search**: Number of results and cosine similarity threshold for semantic retrieval
- **Memory management**: How much recent chat history is kept or summarized
- **Reasoning strategies**: Predefined step-by-step thinking templates for generating responses

**Reasoning Strategies**

Defined under `reasoning_strategies`, these templates structure how the assistant reasons through complex questions:

- **CoT (Chain of Thought)**
  - Break the problem into logical steps before giving the answer. (default)

- **ReAct (Reason + Act)**
  - Uses a cycle of *Thought ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Observation ‚Üí Reflection* to iteratively build the answer.

- **Self-Ask**
  - Breaks the question into sub-questions, answers each one, and combines them into a final response.

To change the default strategy:

```yaml
llm: "llama-3.1-8b-instant"

vectordb:
  threshold: 0.3
  n_results: 5

memory_strategies:
  trimming_window_size: 6
  summarization_max_tokens: 1000

reasoning_strategies:
  default: "CoT"
```

### 3. `prompt_config.yaml`

Path: `src/config/prompt_config.yaml`

Defines how prompts are constructed for the language model. This includes:

- **Role and tone**: Tells the model it‚Äôs a review-based assistant for pet services
- **Instructions**: Ensures the assistant only uses retrieved reviews to answer
- **Constraints**: Prevents speculation, external knowledge, or breaking character
- **Output format**: Enforces Markdown and concise answers

Example snippet:

```yaml
prompt:
  system_message: |
    You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based on customer reviews.
  user_template: |
    Based on the reviews, answer the following question: {question}
```

### 4. paths.py

Path: `src/config/paths.py`

Centralized Python module that defines key file system paths used throughout the project, such as:
- Path to raw and processed data
- Vector DB storage
- Chat history DB

Keeping all path definitions here allows for easier refactoring and consistency across modules.
